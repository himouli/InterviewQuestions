A:
As the manager, it's essential to address your engineer's frustration with changing priorities in a supportive and constructive manner. Here's how you can handle the situation:

## Acknowledge Their Frustration: 
Start by acknowledging your engineer's feelings and frustrations. Let them know that you understand how constant changes in priorities can be challenging and that you're 
there to support them.

## Listen Actively: 
Allow your engineer to express their concerns and frustrations openly. Listen actively without interrupting, and validate their feelings. This demonstrates empathy and 
shows that you value their perspective.

## Provide Context: 
Offer context behind the changing priorities. Explain any external factors or business needs driving the changes. Help your engineer understand the rationale behind the 
shifting focus, which can alleviate some of their frustration.

## Prioritize Tasks Together: 
Collaborate with your engineer to prioritize their tasks based on the current requirements and objectives. Clarify which tasks are most critical and ensure they have 
a clear understanding of what needs to be done first.

## Maintain Open Communication: 
Keep the lines of communication open with your engineer. Regularly update them on any changes in priorities or project requirements. Encourage them to ask questions or 
seek clarification whenever needed.

## Provide Stability When Possible: 
Whenever feasible, try to provide stability by minimizing unnecessary changes in priorities. Consistently shifting focus can lead to 
frustration and decreased productivity. Aim to maintain a sense of stability where possible.

## Offer Support and Resources: 
Ensure your engineer has the necessary resources, support, and guidance to adapt to changing priorities effectively. This may include additional training, access 
to relevant information, or assistance from other team members.

## Empower Them to Manage Their Workload: 
Help your engineer develop strategies for managing their workload in the face of changing priorities. Encourage them to break tasks into smaller, more manageable 
chunks and to communicate proactively if they're feeling overwhelmed.

## Celebrate Achievements: 
Recognize and celebrate your engineer's accomplishments, even amidst changing priorities. Highlight their resilience, adaptability, and ability to deliver results 
despite challenges.

## Address Systemic Issues: 
If changing priorities are a recurring issue within the organization, consider addressing any underlying systemic issues that may be contributing to the problem. 
This could involve refining processes, improving communication channels, or reevaluating decision-making frameworks.

By handling the situation in this manner, you can support your engineer through their frustration with changing priorities while fostering a positive and productive 
work environment.
