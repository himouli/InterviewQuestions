How did I prepare for Amazon behavioural interviews 3.5 years ago?

Here is a 4 step process.

# 1

Write down one sentence with few keywords for each of your stories.

Example:

John, code review, less time, conflict. <- SDE

Team, not working collaboratively, goal turning red <- SDM

These are your trigger words.

You don't need to write the complete story.

# 2

Now create a google sheet.

Put all of these sentences in one column.

In the next column, map them to all the Amazon's leadership principles (LP).

Amazon has 16 LP.

What if I am not preparing for Amazon?

I would still do that, irrespective of the company I am preparing for.

Because the way Amazon has explained them and put them publicly, no other company has done it.

They cover everything. You just have to name it.

At this point you have all your stories mapped to Amazon's 16 LP.

You will notice some stories are mapped to more than one LP.

Which is completely fine.

# 3

Create another column in your google sheet, called Impact.

Calculate and quantify the impact of each story.

Why?

If you are reading my post, most probably you are either an engineer or an engineering manager.

Ask yourself, what do you like the most? The NUMBERS.

So why not tell interviewer the same.

There are very few stories for which you won't be able to quantify the impact, but that is for some other time.

So far, you have 3 columns in google sheet:

Story keywords, Amazon LP, Impact.

# 4

Now you need to create another column, called loopholes.

In this column write down the loopholes you see in your story.

Remember, you don't need to write the complete story.

You need to write answers for the loopholes in your story.

What are loopholes?

They are those details of your story, which are not well thought of.

For example:

John, code review, less time, conflict ->

Why John didn't approve your code review?

Did your team had code review guidelines?

Has this happened with you in the past?

How long you have been in the team?

Were you not aware of guidelines?

This list can go on and on.

If you don't write them, you will:

- either end up changing your answer multiple times,
- or waste 2-3 minutes in thinking and then saying things which have more loopholes.  

So think upfront, what really happened in these stories.

That's all. Congrats, now you are prepared for the behavioural interview.
